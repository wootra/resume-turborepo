I think google logo with animation is pretty cool. To make it, it might need some scripts or graphical libraries.

<video controls="" autoplay="" transition:persist>
  <source src={video} type="video/mp4" />
</video>

## using only CSS?
But I wanted to make it only using CSS. 
Since there are multiple phases in this video, I decided to make them 3 different parts.

### 1. jumping dots.
<GoogleJumpingDots />

This process looks like easy animations on dots with delays. [Source Code](https://github.com/wootra/resume-turborepo/blob/main/apps/astro-resume/src/components/css/GoogleJumpingDots.astro)

But to make the motion naturally, it need a little trials.
Basically, I made 4 dots wrapped with containers, and put animations on both container and dots.
The container makes the dots aligned on top of the container, and the dots are combinations of 2 circles and its body.
The top circle is `(::before)` connected on top of the rectangular body, and only the rectangular body is resized.
and its position is controlled by changing height.

### 2. merging dots.

### 3. opening circles

<GoogleLogoByCSS style="width: 100px; height: 100px"/>

This process need a little thought process. [Source Code](https://github.com/wootra/resume-turborepo/blob/main/apps/astro-resume/src/components/css/GoogleLogoByCSS.astro)
