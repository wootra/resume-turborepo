# {frontmatter.title}

I think google logo with animation is pretty cool. To make it, it might need some scripts or graphical libraries.

<video controls="" autoplay="" transition:persist>
  <source src={video} type="video/mp4" />
</video>

## using only CSS?
But I wanted to make it only using CSS. 
Since there are multiple phases in this video, I decided to make them 3 different parts.

### 1. jumping dots.
<GoogleJumpingDots />

This process looks like easy animations on dots with delays. 



### 2. merging dots.

### 3. opening circles

<GoogleLogoByCSS style="width: 100px; height: 100px"/>

This process need a little thought process.
